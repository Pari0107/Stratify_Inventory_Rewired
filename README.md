## Inventory Rewired


### Project Overview
Inventory Rewired aims to optimize inventory and replenishment decisions across a fictional retail supply chain to reduce stockouts and excess inventory holding costs by 10% over a simulated 3-month horizon. The project focuses on Retail Craft Pvt. Ltd., which operates 3 urban stores in India with a portfolio of 10 SKUs, dealing with issues of stockouts for fast movers and overstock for slow-moving SKUs.

- Saves results into an Excel file Ss_policy_results.xlsx.

**2. Replenishment Simulation and Inventory Tracking**

- Loads inventory, SKU parameters, demand comparison data from Excel.
- Integrates reorder points and lead time adjustments (including delay rates).
